Get ANT from Apache Ant website and get the tar.gz file.
Extract it using tar vxf apache-ant-1.9.4-bin.tar.gz


Navigate to bin folder under Apache Ant folder and 
ant -v
Apache Ant(TM) version 1.9.4 compiled on April 29 2014
Trying the default build file: build.xml
Buildfile: build.xml does not exist!
Build failed



Something like this would be printed if you have correctly install ANT
4. Setup the environmental variables for ANT
vim ~/.bash_profile
export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
export GRADLE_HOME=/Users/mkyong/gradle
export M2_HOME=/Users/mkyong/apache-maven-3.1.1

# Apache Ant
export ANT_HOME=/Users/mkyong/apache-ant-1.9.4

# Export to PATH
export PATH=$PATH:$GRADLE_HOME/bin:$M2_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin
Now you should be able to run the ant -v  command anywhere
5. In order to use ant with sonarqube try running
